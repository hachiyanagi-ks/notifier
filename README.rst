Notifier
=======================

This is a django application for edX platform notifications.

It currently sends daily digests of new content to subscribed forums
users, with a goal of eventually supporting real-time and batched
notifications of various types of content across various channels
(e.g. SMS).

Getting Started
-------------------------------

To run tests: ``python manage.py test notifier``

To start the celery worker: ``python manage.py celery worker``

To start the scheduler (triggers forums digest notifications on a regular interval): ``python manage.py scheduler``

To manually trigger the nightly forums digest batch job, or to perform other diagnostics (use --help to see
options): ``python manage.py forums_digest``

Internationalization and Localization
----

edX uses Transifex to host translations. To use the Transifex client, be sure it is installed (``pip install -r requirements.txt`` will do this for you), and follow the instructions here__ to set up your ``.transifexrc`` file.

__ http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/1000855-configuring-the-client

Django relies on GNU's gettext utilities, which must be installed on your system (packages are available via ``brew`` on OS X and ``apt-get`` on Ubuntu Linux) and on the PATH of the shell from which you run the commands below.

To extract and upload translatable strings:  ``python manage.py makemessages -l en_US; tx push -s``

To download and compile a translation: ``tx pull -l <locale>; python manage.py compilemessages``, where ``<locale>`` is the `locale name`__ for the desired language.

__ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/#term-locale-name

To run the notifier in a language other than English, set the ``NOTIFIER_LANGUAGE`` environment variable to the `language code`__ for the desired language.
