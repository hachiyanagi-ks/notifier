Notifier
=======================

This is a django application for edX platform notifications.

It currently sends daily digests of new content to subscribed forums
users, with a goal of eventually supporting real-time and batched
notifications of various types of content across various channels
(e.g. SMS).

Getting Started
-------------------------------

To run tests: ``python manage.py test notifier``

To start the celery worker: ``python manage.py celery worker``

To start the scheduler (triggers forums digest notifications on a regular interval): ``python manage.py scheduler``

To manually trigger the nightly forums digest batch job, or to perform other diagnostics (use --help to see
options): ``python manage.py forums_digest``
